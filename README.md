## Purpose

Open a tab between other tabs, and name it.

This allows grouping tabs by subject.

This is done using a very simple standalone local web page.

## Works Well With

This works well in Firefox with the 
[Vertical Tabs Reloaded](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs-reloaded/) 
add-on.

## Adding to Bookmarks Bar

Adding a bookmark to this page, in your bookmarks bar, makes it easier to open
the page quickly when needed.
